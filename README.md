# Q&A: System Based on Google Palm LLM and Langchain

This is a comprehensive LLM project built on Langchain and Google Palm. For the e-learning company,Â we are developing a Q&A system. Students will be able to ask questions and receive answers via this system's streamlit-based user interface. 


## Project Highlights

- Utilise an original CSV file containing frequently asked questions (FAQs). 
- The human staff will utilise this file to aid students in their course.
- We aim to develop an LLM-powered question and response system that will efficiently reduce the burden on their human workforce.


## Tools
